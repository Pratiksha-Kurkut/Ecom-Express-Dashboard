# Ecom-Express-Dashboard
Ecom Express Sales Performance Dashboard built using Power BI to analyze revenue, AOV, order count, and cancellation rate. The dashboard visualizes revenue by product, category, state, and time, enabling insights into sales trends, top performers, and business performance through interactive KPIs and charts.
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Ecom Express sales performance, enabling stakeholders to monitor key business metrics and identify revenue trends across products, categories, regions, and time periods.
The dashboard highlights total revenue, average order value (AOV), order count, cancellation rate, and revenue loss due to cancellations, offering quick insights into overall business health. Interactive visuals display revenue by product name, revenue by category, and state-wise revenue distribution, helping identify top-performing products, categories, and regions.
A year- and quarter-wise revenue trend analysis helps track business growth and seasonal fluctuations, supporting data-driven decision-making. Dynamic category filters allow users to drill down into specific product segments such as mobiles, laptops, accessories, and more.
This project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, DAX calculations, KPI creation, and interactive dashboard design using Power BI, making it suitable for sales analysis and business intelligence reporting.
